abstract: "We introduce a novel perspective on set-class analysis combining the DFT magnitudes with the music visualisation technique of
wavescapes. With such a combination, we create a visual representation of a piece’s multidimensional qualia, where different colours indicate saliency in chromaticity, diadicity, triadicity, octatonicity, diatonicity, and whole-tone quality. At the centre of our methods are: 1) the formal definition of the _Fourier Qualia Space_ (FQS), 2) its particular ordering of DFT coefficients that delineate regions linked to different musical aesthetics, and 3) the mapping of such regions into a coloured wavescape. Furthermore, we demonstrate the intrinsic capability of the FQS to express qualia ambiguity and map it into a synopsis wavescape.
Finally, we showcase the application of our methods by presenting a few
analytical remarks on Bach’s _Three-part Invention_ BWV 795, Debussy’s
_Reflets dans l’eau_, and Webern’s _Four Pieces for Violin and Piano_, Op. 7, No. 1, unveiling increasingly ambiguous wavescapes."
