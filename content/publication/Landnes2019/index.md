abstract: |
  This paper models predictive processing of chords using
  a corpus of Ludwig van Beethoven’s string quartets. A
  recently published dataset consisting of expert harmonic
  analyses of all Beethoven string quartets was used to evaluate an 
  $n$-gram language model as well as a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture based on long-short-term
  memory (LSTM). We compare model performances over
  different periods of Beethoven’s creative activity and provide a baseline 
  for future research on predictive processing of chords in full Roman numeral representation on this dataset
