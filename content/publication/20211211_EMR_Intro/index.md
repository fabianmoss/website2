abstract: "Empirical musicology crucially relies on the creation, publication, distribution, and analysis of data. Despite the progress made over the past decades in this vibrating field, numerous issues regarding the accessibility, sharing, and linkage of data, the reproducibility of research findings, and the general role of transparency remain challenging. In many disciplines, these issues are addressed under the umbrella of the Open Science movement and the adherence to the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for scientific data management (Wilkinson et al., 2016)."
