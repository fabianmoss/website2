abstract: "A major limitation of current Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems is that their performance strongly depends on the variability in the input images. What for human readers seems almost trivial---e.g., reading music in a range of different font types in different contexts---can drastically reduce the output quality of OMR models. This paper introduces the 19MT-OMR corpus that can be used to test OMR models on a diverse set of sources. We illustrate this challenge by discussing several examples from this data set."
