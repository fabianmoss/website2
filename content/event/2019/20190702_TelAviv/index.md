summary: "What can we infer about tonality from distributions of notes in musical pieces?"
abstract: "Pitch-class distributions are widely used in corpus-based Computational Musicology, e.g. to
determine the mode or key of musical pieces, or to infer style-specific characteristics (De Clerq
& Temperley, 2011; Broze & Shanahan, 2013). Unfortunately, research is often confined by
specific representations of musical pieces due to MIDI-encoded data that renders, for
instance, the distinction between enharmonically equivalent pitch classes (e.g. F# and Gb)
and between diatonic and chromatic intervals (e.g. m2 and A1) impossible. Moreover,
historical changes of these distributions are only recently being studied on a larger scale
(Tymoczko, 2011; Albrecht & Huron, 2014; White, 2014; Yust, 2019), while many approaches
assume more or less immutable abstract “tone profiles” (Krumhansl, 1990). These
shortcomings are addressed by analyzing distributions of “tonal pitch classes” (TPCs;
Temperley, 2000) in a large dataset of more than 2000 MusicXML-encoded pieces by 75
composers covering a historical range of almost 600 years.
It is shown that the order on the line of fifths can be inferred both from TPC distributions of
pieces as well as diachronically. Moreover, a mathematical model is used to show that
composers progressively use third-based tonal relations in an increasingly explorative
manner. Thus, the historically changing distributions of TPCs allow to expose large-scale
changes in compositional practices. The present approach argues that adequate models for
musical notes and pieces as well as the acknowledgement of historical changes are
indispensable for the computational study of tonality."
