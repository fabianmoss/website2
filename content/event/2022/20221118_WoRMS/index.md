summary: This paper introduces the 19MT-OMR
  corpus that can be used to test OMR models on a diverse set
  of sources. We illustrate this challenge by discussing several
  examples from this dataset.
abstract: |
  A major limitation of current Optical Music Recog-
  nition (OMR) systems is that their performance strongly depends
  on the variability in the input images. What for human readers
  seems almost trivial—e.g., reading music in a range of different
  font types in different contexts—can drastically reduce the output
  quality of OMR models. This paper introduces the 19MT-OMR
  corpus that can be used to test OMR models on a diverse set
  of sources. We illustrate this challenge by discussing several
  examples from this dataset.
