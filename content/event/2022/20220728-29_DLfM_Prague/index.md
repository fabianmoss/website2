abstract: "We introduce phantom curves, a novel music-theoretical concept based on the
  discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and document the creative process that led
  to their discovery. In particular, we emphasize the importance of interactive
  web applications for music visualization and analysis. This is demonstrated
  using the example of the application midiVERTO which affords interactions
  with the pitch-class content of musical pieces encoded in MIDI format with-
  out requiring in-depth understanding of the underlying mathematics. We
  illustrate the analytical value of studying families of phantom curves by
  applying the concept to music from a Broadway musical, a video game, and
  a Hollywood movie. This process of discovery thus testifies to the fact that
  digital tools can bridge disciplinary boundaries between music theory and
  mathematics, and this interaction can generate new scientific knowledge."
