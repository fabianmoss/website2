abstract: |
  In jazz theory and pedagogy, the so-called chord-scale 
  theory (CST) is a widely-used system to
  describe and prescribe associations of scales to chords and vice 
  versa. Despite its dominance, a
  large-scale empirical evaluation of its significance for jazz history 
  has not yet been carried out. In
  particular, the exact nature of mappings between chords and scales is 
  debated, in particular regarding the inherent tension between vertical 
  (chordal) and horizontal (melodic) tone coordination
  as well as the influence of larger tonal areas on scale selection.
  Here, we evaluate CST empirically by drawing on a corpus of 456 jazz 
  solos contained in the
  Weimar Jazz Database. We give a comprehensive description of pitch 
  choices in (tonal)
  jazz solos with regard to underlying chord types and their scale 
  degree, and determine the most
  commonly used scales over the most relevant chord types using suitable 
  matching algorithms.
  Finally, we present three case studies that address important 
  phenomena in jazz harmonic theory in
  more depth: 1) tritone substitutions of dominants, 2) fully diminished 
  chords and their underlying
  scale(s), and 3) the role of the sixth scale degree in pre-dominant 
  chords. Our study demonstrates
  how musicological theories can be evaluated empirically and provides 
  the first comprehensive
  overview of actual pitch and scale use in jazz history. Results 
  indicate that scale choices for chords
  with a diatonic interpretation are influenced by their local scale 
  degree and thus by local (or global)
  key contexts, whereas inherently non-diatonic chords allow for more 
  freedom. Generally, the presence of chromaticism beginning in the 
  early jazz styles blurs the mapping of scales to chords and renders 
  the question of the prevalence of melodic and chordal thinking. This 
  suggests the need for a more integrated approach to adequately 
  describe chord-scale relationships.
