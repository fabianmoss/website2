summary:
abstract: We present _MonodiKit_, a Python library for the analysis and processing of medieval chant documents. 
  While MonodiKit was designed
  specifically for working with data in the monodi+ data format as
  edited by the Corpus Monodicum project, its comprehensive set
  of tools and classes offers a wide range of functionalities, such as
  parsing and processing of chant documents, exploring their hierarchical structure, 
  managing metadata, generating musical notation,
  and extracting relevant information. The library thus enables re-
  searchers and scholars to conduct in-depth computational analyses
  of the chants, in particular by providing a basic interface to the
  more common MEI format. This paper introduces the key features
  of MonodiKit, presents its design and implementation, and presents
  a case study demonstrating its capabilities as an interface for corpus
  studies of medieval chant.
